I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it) (since 2022).  My work focuses on natural language processing, speech technologies, signal processing, multimodal learning and explainable AI.

I earned an MSc in Artificial Intelligence (2021, with honors) and a BSc in Computer Engineering (2019) from the University of Bologna. I have research experience as a visiting researcher at [Sony AI](https://ai.sony/) (2025), [MILA Québec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec) (2023) and as an intern at [i2CAT Foundation](https://www.i2cat.net) (2021). My contributions span speech emotion recognition, fairness, interpretability and multimodal deep learning, with publications in venues such as ACL, EACL, IJCAI and journals such as ISWA and JAIR.

*Research Interests: Multimodal Learning • Speech Processing • Interpretability*

<!-- I have participated in European projects like HumanE-AI-Net and 5GMED, received the AIxIA 2022 Best Doctoral Consortium Paper Award, and served the academic community as a teacher, volunteer, and alumni coordinator. -->
